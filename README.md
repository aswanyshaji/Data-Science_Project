## Requirements
- The project was initiated by creating a virtual environment using Anaconda to manage dependencies efficiently.  fter setting up the environment, all required packages were installed using the requirements.txt file. This setup ensures an isolated environment for the project, managing dependencies effectively.
## Development Environment and code Structure
The project was developed using the VS Code editor, with the front end built in HTML and the back end implemented using FastAPI. The main program is centered around FastAPI, which serves as the core of the application's backend logic. The project is organized in such a way that all functionalities are called through FastAPI. The FastAPI logic is distinctly separated from other components. This architecture ensures that the main FastAPI program efficiently handles API requests and responses, while other functionalities are invoked as needed. The frontend, designed using HTML, provides a user-friendly interface that interacts with the FastAPI backend. This structured approach enhances the maintainability and clarity of the project, facilitating easy extension and modification.
